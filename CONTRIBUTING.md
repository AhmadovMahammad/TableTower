We welcome contributions from everyone.

Before you begin, ensure you have a local copy of the repository and the latest changes from the main branch. When you are ready to work on a new feature or fix, create a new branch using a clear and descriptive name, for example feature/add-pagination-support or fix/table-rendering-bug.

Make your changes in that branch, writing clear commit messages that explain what you did and why. Once your work is complete, push the branch to your fork or directly to the repository and open a pull request against main. In your pull request description, include a concise summary of the changes and any relevant context or testing details. We will review your pull request as soon as possible, provide feedback if needed, and merge it once it meets project guidelines.

Thank you for contributing to TableTower and helping improve its functionality and usability.
